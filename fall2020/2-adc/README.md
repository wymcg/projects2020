# Penn State IEEE
## Analog to Digital Converters Workshop
September 17, 2020

### About
This project served to teach attendees about basic concepts in Arduino programming and analog to digital converters(ADCs). Attendees were provided with a breadboard, an Arduino Uno, and the relevant components necessary to complete the circuits described in the presentation. Participants completed several examples utilizing the Arduino Uno's built in ADC and the provided skeleton code files. This event was held remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
